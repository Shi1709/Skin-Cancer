## Skin Cancer Detection Model

A deep learning model for early detection of skin cancer through dermoscopic image classification.

### Key Features
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** to classify **2,000+ images** into **7 lesion categories**.
- Achieved **91% test accuracy**.
- Enhanced generalization (+18%) with **data augmentation** (rotation, rescaling, shift, zoom, shear, flips).
- Designed a **custom CNN** with 3 convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and dense layers.
- Integrated **model checkpointing** to save the best model during training, ensuring robust and early detection.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib
